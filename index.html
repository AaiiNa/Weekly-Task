      <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>

      <p class="p"><em>JavaScript</em> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
        interactive
        (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server
        side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply
        downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
        control over them.</p>
      <p class="p"><em>JavaScript</em> contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
        set of
        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>


      <ul class="li">
        <br>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
          Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
          an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
          server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
          continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
          on a server.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>What you should already know </h1>

      <p class="p"> This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>


      <ul class="li">
        <br>
        <li> A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web <strong>(WWW)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language <strong>(HTML)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page
          about JavaScript.</li>

    <section class="main">
      <h1> JavaScript and Java </h1>
      <p class="p"> JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
        JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
        follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason
        why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. </p>
      <p class="p">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
        runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
        prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
        objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      <p class="p"> JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
        classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected,
        and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
        typed. </p>

    <section class="main">
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <p class="p"> To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
        JavaScript code: </p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>(function(){</li>
        <li> "use strict";</li>
        <li>/* Start of your code */</li>
        <li>function greetMe(yourName) {</li>
        <li> alert('Hello ' + yourName);</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>
        <li> greetMe('World ');</li>
        <li>/* End of your code */</li>
        <li>})(); </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="p">Press <button>Cmd</button>+<buttoon>Enter</button> or <button>Ctrl</button>+<button>Enter</button>

    <section class="main">
      <h1> Variables </h1>
      <p class="p">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
        identifiers, conform to certain rules</p>
      <p class="p">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore <strong>(_)</strong>, or dollar sign
        <strong>($)</strong>. Subsequent characters can also be digits <strong>(0–9)</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters <strong>"A"</strong> through
        <strong>"Z"</strong> (uppercase) as well as <strong>"a"</strong> through <strong>"z"</strong> (lowercase).</p>
      <p class="p"> You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
        Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
        _name. </p>

    </section>

    <br>

    <section class="main">
      <h1> Declaring variables </h1>
      <p class="p"> You can declare a variable in two ways: </p>
      <p class="p"> With the keyword var. For example, </p>
      <p class="p"> var x = 42. </p>
      <p class="p"> This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. </p>
      <p class="p"> By simply assigning it a value. For example,
        x = 42. </p>
      <p class="p"> This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
        this variant. </p>
      <p class="p"> With the keyword let. For example,
        let y = 13. </p>
      <p class="p"> This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>

    </section>

    <br>

    <section class="main">
      <h1> Variable scope </h1>
      <p class="p"> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
        available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called
        a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
      <p class="p"> JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
        within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
        following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is
        declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement. </p>

      <ol class="ol">
        <li> if (true) {</li>
        <li> var x = 5; </li>
        <li> } </li>
        <li> console.log(x); // x is 5 </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="p"> This behavior changes when using the let declaration (introduced in ECMAScript 2015). </p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li> if (true) { </li>
        <li> let y = 5; </li>
        <li> } </li>
        <li> console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined </li>
      </ol>

      <br>

    </section>

    <section class="main">

      <h1> Global variables </h1>

      <p class="p">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
        window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>

        <p class="p"> Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
        frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
        document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumbe</p>

    </section>

    <br>

<section class="main">

<h1> Constants  </h1>
<p class="p">You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
 
<ol class="li">
<li>
  const PI = 3.14;
</li>
</ol>
 
<p class="p"> A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
<p class="p"> The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.  </p>
<p class="p">  You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:  </p>

<ol class="li">
<li> // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR </li>
<li> function f() {}; </li>
<li> const f = 5; </li>
<li>  </li>
<li> // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO </li>
<li> function f() { </li>
<li>  const g = 5; </li>
<li>    var g;</li>
<li>  </li>
<li>   //statements </li>
<li>  </li>
<li> } </li>
</ol>

<p class="p"> However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>

<ol class="li">
<li>  const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'}; </li>
<li>  MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue'; </li>

</ol>

<h1> Data types </h1>
<p class="p"> The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:   </p>
 
<ul class="li">
  <li> Six data types that are primitives: </li>
</ul>

<ol class="li">
<li>  Boolean. true and false.  </li>
<li>  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is   </li>
<li>case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
<li>   undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined. </li>
<li>   Number. 42 or 3.14159. </li>
<li>   String. "Howdy" </li>
<li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable</li>

</ol>

<ul class="li">

<li> and Object  </li>
